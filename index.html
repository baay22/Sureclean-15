                <h2>Common Source of Unexplained Odor on Your Sofa</h2>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 400px; width: 40%;" src="https://sureclean.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/paul-weaver-nWidMEQsnAQ-unsplash.jpg"></div>
                <p>If you’ve noticed an unexplained odor on your sofa, there are several common sources to consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Pets</b>: If you have pets, they may be responsible for the odor. Pet hair, dander, and sometimes accidents can lead to unpleasant smells. Regular cleaning and deodorizing can help mitigate this issue.</li>
                    <li><b>Food and Drink Spills</b>: Food and drink spills are common culprits for sofa odors. Even small spills can seep into the fabric and create unpleasant smells over time if not properly cleaned.</li>
                    <li><b>Sweat and Body Odor</b>: Over time, body oils, sweat, and body odor can accumulate on your sofa’s fabric, especially if you frequently use it for relaxation or napping. Regularly cleaning the sofa and using fabric fresheners can help.</li>
                    <li><b>Mold and Mildew</b>: If your sofa has been exposed to moisture or humidity, mold and mildew can develop, leading to a musty odor. This is more common in damp environments or if the sofa is near a window or door where moisture can seep in.</li>
                    <li><b>Stale Air</b>: Sometimes, simply not using or ventilating your sofa area can lead to a stale or musty smell. Proper ventilation and occasional freshening up can help prevent this.</li>
                    <li><b>Environmental Factors</b>: Your home’s environment can contribute to sofa odors. Smoking, cooking, or even nearby industrial activities can introduce unwanted odors into your living space.</li>
                    <li><b>Chemical Off-Gassing</b>: Some sofas may release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or chemicals used in their manufacturing process, leading to a chemical or plastic-like smell. This odor can dissipate over time but maybe bothersome initially.</li>
                    <li><b>Insect Infestation</b>: In rare cases, insects such as beetles or mites can infest the sofa’s stuffing, leading to an unpleasant odor. If you suspect this, it’s essential to address the infestation promptly.</li>
                </ul>
